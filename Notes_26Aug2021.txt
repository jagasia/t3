Yesterday we created a spring boot rest api
	that authenticate users and returned a JWT Token
	then the users use that token in their "header" called as "Authorization" in all their other requests

Angular + Spring JWT 
	like in spring, we used jjwt dependency and created JwtUtil class that 
		generated token
		validate token
		get username from the token
		check for expiry

	same way, in angular also, we have utility that can do such jwt related tasks

		npm install jwt-decode


	this should be installed inside an angular project		(try with -g for global)

	this jwt_decode provide in 				jwt.io
	same way in angular

		return jwt_decode.default('eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJkaW5lc2giLCJleHAiOjE2Mjk5NDE1NTEsImlhdCI6MTYyOTkwNTU1MX0.8h2bSNjl-P7jq8AJr2-B-pED0NOROgx458eH_8pR4WA');


		in order to use this jwt_decoe, we installed the same


		http status code 200		OK

		when we retrieve String from rest api	
		so we can return objects from rest api


from angular, (during login), we send an object of AuthRequest
	AuthRequest
		ng g class auth-request
		ng g c login
		ng g c home
			from home, we call any other method using token

		one utility that will automatically take the token from localStorage and assign it to header
			"Authorization" header
