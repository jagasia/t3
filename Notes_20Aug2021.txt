-----------------------------
Yesterday
	we deployed a spring application + mysql in docker
	we used docker-compose.yml 
		we define two services:
			1) spring app
			2) mysql db

Day before yesterday, we used docker network to do the same. 

What is the cloud?
Cloud service models:
	IAAS
	PAAS
	SAAS

Deployment model:
	private
	public
	hybrid		public + private

Cloud Service Providers	
	AWS, Azure, GCP

Kubernetes
	in aws, EKS	Elastic Kubernetes Service
Container
	in aws, ECS	Elastic Container Service

What are the services provided by Cloud?
	i)	Storage
			Elastic Block Storage (EBS)		
			Elastic File System	(EFS)
	ii)	Compute
			Elastic Compute Cloud	(EC2)
				Elastic Beanstalk		(we are going to use today)
				ECS, EKS
				Relational Database Service (RDS)
					mysql database will be created here
	iii)	Network
			VPC, subnets, security groups



1) Deploy spring boot application + mysql in AWS
	i) creating account in aws
	ii) deploy our jar/war in Elastic Beanstalk
	
Scalability
	ability to grow or shrink to meet the demand/need
		using the existing infra

Elasticity
	Elastic scalability
		by extending infra	
		by provisioning or deprovisioning infra
			subscribe more resource or less based on need
Autoscaling
	AWS
	


1) create an application in aws
	sample application is already available in aws itself.	

2) we create a spring boot application (simple. which does not have mysql database)

3) add mysql database to the existing application

4) mvc project with front end and back end




1) login to aws
2) in Elastic Beanstalk
	create application
		name
		java is the env
		configure more option


So, we have created an application, and configured VPC with availability zone as south1-a and south1-b

in application.properties: change the server.port			8080 never worked. i changed to 5000


mysql:
	once we create a mysql database in our application configuration,
	it will not allow public access unless configured
		security groups
			default
				inbound rules
					by default:		all tcp
					we will change it to 	all traffic	(this will allow applications to acc)



root
rootuser






firstName	FIRST_NAME


so we deployed .jar file in "java" environment
what to do? to deploy war?????
create an application
	env should not be "java" env, but "tomcat"

an application depends on 
	vpc
	rds database sometimes

we can delete the application first		GOOD IDEA
	before deleting the the application, if we delete, database, or VPC, or subnet

then if we try to delete the application, it will tell that this application was using db, vpc that is removed now. You cannot delete the application.


delete VPC
