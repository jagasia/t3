What is the need for Logging?
What is Log4j?
How it will be useful?

error message


Spring CLI

	spring run something.groovy


Rolling file logger is nothing but will create new file once a specific size is reached

Convention in logging:
the stdout logger usually display time of the event.
the file logger stores the date and time of the event.


file upload, displaying images		(today)

Every user when  they signup, they can upload their profile picture also.

uploading picture as a separate form only.
BUT I AM GOING TO SHOW HOW we can upload pic as a part of form that includes other details also (fname, lname, etc)

why they upload image in a separate form???

1) GET mapping it is not possible
2) POST PUT are allowed

in rest api
public void addUser(User user)
	here, lob is not accepted

so what we are going to do is?
	public void addUser(@RequestParam String username, String password, ....., MultipartFile file)

in angular side,
	create a formdata and send
		
LET's add a pic column in the user table in mysql 
	ALTER TABLE USER ADD (pic longblob);
Lets add a property in java class	User.java

public User signuppic(@RequestParam("username") String username, @RequestParam String password, @RequestParam String firstName,@RequestParam String lastName,@RequestParam String dateOfBirth,@RequestParam String email, MultipartFile pic)

formdata.append('username','');
formdata.append('password','');
formdata.append('firstName','');
formdata.append('lastName','');
formdata.append('dateOfBirth','');
formdata.append('email','');
formdata.append('pic','');


in jsp:


<form	method="POST" action="signup">
	............
	...........
	...........
	..........
	submit
</form>

query string

?username=abcd&password


url?key=value			@RequestParam
url/value			@PathVariable




jersey framework

spring framework

spring boot makes it easy
	content negotiation
	automatically choose the best format based on data received or sent

consumes
	parameter content types
produces
	return value types
