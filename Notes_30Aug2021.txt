Last class we checked sonarqube and analysed the code quality of a java application
	i installed java 11 and updated env variables
	also updated spring tool suite for Jdk 11

But, what actually works well	
	install jdk 11 and set env var
	start sonar qube server
	But the project created in jdk 11 was not building successfully when we use sonar jacoco clean install & build
		solution:
			create project in jdk 1.8 	
			and use <properties> for jdk 1.8
			
		this works

i will give demo if required.

Today as I mentioned, 
	lets deploy an angular app in AWS using Continuous Integration with GitHub

	ie., we push the project into git and reflect it in Elastic Beanstalk

1) in aws elastic beanstalk, lets create an application 
	(earlier we have done this but for java application (spring boot application). The env was "java"

	This time (instead of java), we will chose "node js" env

	As usual, there will be a sample application that can be deployed. 
2) when it takes time to create our application in aws, we can create a simple angular project

3) in aws, sample app is up.
	we are going to "Code pipeline" where, we can choose "GitHub" as source and do authorization
	we can choose github repository and link it to the elastic beanstalk application

4) we change the angular application in vs code
	and push the changes into git hub
	and expect the changes to reflect in the aws 





t3-ci-1






git init

git add .

git commit -m "first commit"

git branch -M jag

git remote add origin https://github.com/jagasia/t3-ci1.git

git push -u origin jag





in aws, navigate to the service "Code pipeline"
create pipeline
	name of the pipeline "t3-ci1"
		all others are unchanged 
		click next
	source provider:
		git hub
		connect to github
			connection name "jag-github"
			choose the repositories	"All repositories"
			then choose the repository and branch
		skip the build stage
	in deploy stage
		choose elastic beanstalk
			choose the app name and env name

	in next step, create pipeline


1) sonar qube
	java project 1.8
	jdk 11 is set to env variable
		properties
		plugin

2) splunk


We need to create an interview bank of Q & A


Observable
	rxjs
