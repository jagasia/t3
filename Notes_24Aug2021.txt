in aws elastic beanstalk, we created an application in an environment
	as a deleting process, i can delete application or terminate environment

	lot of applications were hanging there, while deleting, it was giving an error saying the AWSEBSRDS database is not found
	i have deleted the database first. So i was not allowed to delete application.

	visit cloudformation console and delete the applictions there. it worked


Now, we have created a cluster in EKS	(Elastic Kubernetes Service) in AWS using the following command:
	eksctl create cluster --name t3-cluster-1 --version 1.17 --region ap-south-1 --nodegroup-name linux-nodes --		node-type t2.micro --nodes 2

Now, to deploy the spring boot application in eks, 
	we need to create 2 yml files
		deployment.yml
		service.yml

docker image of spring boot application created yesterday:-

docker.io/library/ecr-demo-1:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT	
docker.io/library/ecr-demo-1:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
	mvn spring-boot:build-image





kubectl get pods
	shows error: 	ImagePullBackOff

add the following in deployment.yml file
	imagePullPolicy: Never




        
        kubectl delete pods --all



kubectl create deployment presto-coordinator \
    --image=warsaw-data-meetup/presto-coordinator:beta0
deployment.apps/presto-coordinator created


kubectl create deployment my-app --image=jagindia/ecr-demo-1:latest
