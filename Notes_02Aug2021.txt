when i push angular project to remote repository, i do not want to push certain folders

node_modules		folder contains around 52k files
			i dont want to upload it


	the solution is to create a file called .gitignore and mention the list of files/folders to ignore while pushing

	

	-m	should be used only if we have used "add" before this command
	-am	can be used without "add" used before. 	
		understands all files in current location

Bootstrap
----------
Grid
	treats a page as 12 column layout

Angular
	to use bootstrap
		simplest way is to copy the cdn in index.html <head> portion
	otherwise
		install bootstrap for a project or globally also

1) scaffolding		basic structure of the website
			*ngIf
			[ngClass]
		

		.........	blank, show error message
		<span *ngIf="true">Passwords does not match</span>


in bootstrap there are some important classes


	table	table-striped table-bordered table-hover
	<thead class="">

Button
	success			btn-success
	warning
	primary
	danger
	info


has-error

alert-danger

CRUD 
form
	user inputs

table in the bottom
..........select
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
JQuery?
	Javascript Query
		IMO is an application of Javascript
	js code can be used in jquery also

	syntax			
		selectors	
		compare 		

			value		val()
			innerText	text()
			innerHTML	html
	AJAX
		javascript
		jquery


use jquery cdn
	directly refer to jquery cdn
	or create a file locally and paste cdn content and use locally

There are lot of textboxes
when cursor goes into a textbox, that textbox should be highlighted (background color should be yellow)


event selector		where is the event occurring		
what is the event	click
what is the event handler	in response to the event what should happen?

every html element has style attribute
	style="background-color"


JQuery:
	selectors
		element
		id
		class
		pseudo




	bootstrap.css
	bootstrap.js
	jquery.js


in jquery, mostly, a programmer stays only inside his <script> tag
he can work independently without disturbing the html code

<input type=button onclick="fn()">

<input type=button id="btn">

$("#btn").click(function(){
});

jag.js

he refers using
<script src="jag.js">

even in js also
	we can stay away from html file and do binding event
	document.getElementById("btn").addEventListener("click",fn1());		//js

	$("#btn").click();

if someone alreay has done common programming tasks and named it as jquery.js

Spring REST
------------

STS	spring tool suite			eclipse is fine		Oxygen or v4

all of you Spring boot MVC

Spring vs Spring boot
-----------------------
	.jar 				main method		core java project 
	embedded tomcat				
	starter dependencies			dependencies are grouped as starter
	convention over configuration

when you work in spring core
	you do lot of configuration
		componenScan
		base directory
		xml file
		
	but in spring boot
		we follow convention
			under base package if we create controllers, we dont need to specify the location
			componentScan

spring boot 

REST can be done without boot also

I learnt RESTful webservices first using "jersey" framework


the idea behind REST is to allow us to share our java code using URL

2001
	allowing client apps to access our java code using URL using "WEB SERVICES"
	SOAP

SOAP shares the entire web service using 1 url

when micro services architecture has come, we need technique to share one method using 1 url

REST
	REpresentational State Transfer		is not a protocol 
		architectural style

SOAP is a protocol
	is rigid			text/xml		format

REST
	support		multiple formats
		text/xml
		text/html
		text/plain
		text/json

	JSON become more preferred format of data interchange

a java object can be sent as json
a json string can be converted into java object

	jersey		we were doing this above conversion manually and then later using gson

Spring boot
	@GetMapping("/employee")
	public List<Employee> getAllEmployee()
	{
		return x;
	}


they will not combine one form
	<form>
		first name
		last name
		Photo:
	</form>



bootstrap cards


http://localhost:8080/employee
	GET http://localhost:8080/employee			all employee as a json array
	GET http://localhost:8080/employee/1			one employee whose id is 1
	POST http://localhost:8080/employee			adding an employee
	PUT http://localhost:8080/employee			modifying an employee
	DELETE http://localhost:8080/employee			deleting an employee

these mappings you are not using in MVC project
	<form method="GET"
	<form method="POST"
		
	PUT/DELETE/PATCH		not used in MVC project

	we created a REST api 
	we accessed the rest api from a MVC project using feign client


GET https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos		all
GET https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/11

POST
PUT
DELETE

you cannot do in browser. So we need to use postman


Accordion			toggle of menus that can collapse or expand
Carousel			pictures that will slide towards left
