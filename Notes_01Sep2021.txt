Sonar Qube
	https://www.sonarqube.org/success-download-community-edition/
There is no installation for sonarqube.
	download from above url and unzip to a known location

	usually people may add the path where "startsonar" is present in "path" env variable.
	so that in any cmd prompt, they can type	"startsonar"	that will start 
	
	or i go to the location and run that startsonar.bat file.		

in my observation, the sonarqube that i have 
	works when the env variables set to Java 11
	and the project is done in 1.8

Lets start sonarqube server


mvn sonar:sonar -Dsonar.projectKey=t3-sonar-11 -Dsonar.host.url=http://localhost:9000 -Dsonar.login=ea6a43ea40b45d4e5f6825c32fd4a3e58360238a

download sonar qube from:
	https://www.sonarqube.org/success-download-community-edition/

unzip and extract to softwares folder
	
start sonar server:
	in sonar folder, go to bin folder -> windows folder,
	run the StartSonar.bat	script

go to the folder that contains "pom.xml"
	mvn clean verify sonar:sonar


sonar qube required java 11

1) Technical debt,  is a concept in software development that reflects 
the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy (limited) solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer.

2) A code smell is any characteristic in the source code of a program that possibly indicates a deeper problem.

3) Code coverage is a metric that can help you understand how much of your source is tested.

Splunk
------
	Splunk is a tool to collect, analyze, forward machine data

what is machine data?
	Log entries

Log entries mostly become dead information. or unnoticed information

This is because of the complex nature of the format of the log information.

Different projects may use different log entry formats.

Splunk understands almost any type of log file

1) go to settings
2) add data
3) upload
4) select source
	select file
5) next



Stage 3 and Stage 4
-----------------------
Theory is not discussed
including today we have 4 days:-
--------------------------------

Create an interview question bank
-----------------------------------
walk from first to last of stage 3 and 4 concepts.

and discuss what are the possible interview questions
	ex: 	what is circuit breaker, load balancer etc


1) angular observable

lambda
	is an ad hoc implementation of a functional interface		JAVA
	in typescript,
		lambda is a quick implementation of anonymous function

instead of creating a function and referring it on the method

lambda is used for callback functions

.subscribe(fn1);		// call this fn1 function when you are ready
.subscribe(()=>{	10 lines	});		// same
//any code here, this code is executed even before the lambda is executed.


our associates will retrieve data from http client (rest api) and patch the data into the form
the patch the data into the form outside lambda

global variable
	result:any;

.subscribe((data)=>{
	this.result=data;
	
});

//outside lambda

this.signupForm.patchValue(result);		///this will give error because, 	this.result=data; is delayed

outside lambda is executed even before lambda is completed.







checkLoginStatus()
  {    
    // alert('check login statyus')
    const myObservable=new Observable(observer=>{
      setTimeout(()=>{
		//business logic here. 			status is the variable whose value we publish in next line
          observer.next(status);
      },100);
    });
    return myObservable;
  }

Kubernetes
	we install 
		"minikube"		for orchestration	locally
		"kubectl"		for orchestration	locally
		"eksctl"		this is for aws

we can create PODS	nodes	etc

cluster????????	
	we need aws/azure/gcp 		real cloud


we successfully created cluster using the following command:
	eksctl create cluster --name test-cluster --version 1.17 --region ap-south-1 --nodegroup-name linux-nodes --node-type t2.micro --nodes 2
